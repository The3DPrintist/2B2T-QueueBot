## Introduction:

The skecpticism twoards the safety of this program is very reasonable, I am working to make sure that the program is as safe as possible.

This program utilises the "latest.log" file that minecraft uses, this file contains no exploitable information.


## Directory Setup:

If the text “latest.log has been located” is visible, you don't have to change anything.

If the text isn't visible, or you are using a different install location, change the text field from the default directory to the correct one, and check the box labeled “Ignore Default Location”

Example of what the directory should look like:
C:/Users/USER/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/logs/latest.log


## Notification Setup:

You can either receive an sms or an email to notify you.

## SMS Setup:

Select your phone provider in the dropdown, If you don't have one of the providers, you can hardcode the email, refer to Email Setup, and use this site.

Input your phone number into the box labeled “Phone Number / Email” with no spaces or special characters.

Example of what the phone number should look like:
1234567890

You may test the message by clicking the “Test Email” button, it has a cooldown.

## Email Setup:

Select “Email instead” in the dropdown.

Input your email address into the box labeled “Phone Number / Email”

You may test the message by clicking the “Test Email” button, it has a cooldown.


## Reset:

The “Reset” button will reload the entire program, this will currently also clear your settings.


## Log:

At the top right of the window is the log, it is a text box that updates over time.

The log is mostly for development, but can be used to see what the log file is saying if you are interested.


Progress Circle & Queue Position:

The right side of the screen contains the progress circle and a text box outlining you current position in the queue.

Once your queue position is 10, the email will be sent, and the progress circle will become green.
